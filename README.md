### Motivation for Building a Programmable TSN Switch  

Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a crucial technology for achieving deterministic communication in various domains, including industrial automation, automotive networks, and telecommunications. However, traditional TSN implementations typically rely on hardware-specific devices, limiting their flexibility and adaptability.  

To bridge this gap, the Linux kernel has recently integrated several TSN-related features, such as the Time-Aware Traffic Shaper (TAPRIO) qdisc, enabling software-based TSN capabilities. By leveraging these features, it is possible to construct a software-based TSN bridge, as demonstrated in our previous [blog post](https://blog.deterministic6g.eu/posts/2024/11/02/software_tsn_switch.html). However, this software bridge comes with some limitations:

- Cumbersome: It relies on additional components, such as `qdisc` and `tc` filters, to classify traffic based on priority, making configuration and management complex.

- Inflexibility: The bridge's behavior is controlled via the `tc` tool from the control plane, which may introduce delays when rapid traffic adaptation is required.

In this blog post, we introduce a software TSN switch programmable with P4, combining the deterministic features of TSN with the flexibility and programmability of P4-enabled data planes. Our switch is built on Linuxâ€™s TAPRIO qdisc, which is essential for traffic shaping in TSN environments. By integrating P4 programmability, the switch enables dynamic traffic management, including real-time packet classification, adaptive scheduling, and in-depth network monitoring. This approach provides a more agile, scalable, and customizable solution for modern deterministic networking needs.

# P4-Programmable Software TSN switch

The P4 Virtual Switch (BMv2) is the key component of the switch, serving as the data plane responsible for packet processing. By utilizing the P4 programming language, the switch allows users to define at runtime how packets are processed, classified, forwarded them to appropriate qdisc ports. This programmability removes the dependency on manual traffic control commands, e.g., tc, enabling flexible and runtime adjustments.

Specifically, the BMv2 virtual switch integrates seamlessly with the taprio qdisc by leveraging Linux packet priority. When a packet enters the BMv2, it undergoes a parsing process defined by the P4 program. This parsing step allows users to extract relevant fields from the packet header and perform logical processing as required. For instance, operations like In-band Network Telemetry (INT) can be implemented to monitor the packet's journey through the network, collecting data on latency, jitter, or path utilization. After completing the logical processing, the VLAN Priority Code Point (PCP) in the packet header is updated to reflect its traffic class or priority. Simultaneously, BMv2 updates the skb->priority value of the packet in the Linux kernel. The taprio qdisc uses this priority value to determine the appropriate output queue for the packet, aligning it with the preconfigured time slots defined in the time-aware schedule. By dynamically setting priorities at runtime, this approach eliminates the need for static configurations or manual intervention, offering greater flexibility in handling diverse traffic patterns.
